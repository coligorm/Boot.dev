# Count Orders by Status

## Complete the `count_orders_by_status` function.

You work on an online store. Each order is stored as a dictionary with at least an `"id"` and a `"status"`.

`count_orders_by_status` should:

- Take a list of order dictionaries
- Return a dictionary that maps each status to how many orders have that status

Use loops and dictionaries to build the result.

If the input list is empty, return an empty dictionary.
